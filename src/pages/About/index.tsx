      <h2>How It Started?</h2>
      <span>
        Although we were established in January 2022, we started working in 2018
        to provide the service you need in <strong><line> the fastest and highest quality way.</line></strong>
        The team that came together in 2018 formed the foundation of the company
        with the support they gave to each other. Our journey, which started by
        saying "let's do it" with the confidence and courage we get from each
        other, still starts with the same excitement by saying "let's do it" for
        every project.
